# Face-Recognition-using-Tkinter
It is a simple face recognition system built by using Tkinter.

## Process
Download the **sourcecode.py** and place it in an empty folder. Now create a new folder with name **faces** as shown in below screenshot
![folder](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ada96e32-b683-4a10-8651-6140ef3e52e1)

**After setting up the folder add some images to the faces folder.**

->name the images as you wish.

->Only png, jpg and jpeg files will work for the code.

**NOTE :**

**.** The name which you have given to the image will be displayed in the output.

**.** Make sure the background of the image you are placing in the faces folder is not messy.

**.** The messy background images will reduce the recognition accuracy.


### After this process
you can just run the code in your idle or text editor(VS Code) or command prompt(CMD).

there will be a Screen poping up. place your **face or image** in the screen for recognition.

Here is the Screenshot of the Output.
